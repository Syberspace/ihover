## Intro
iHover is a collection of hover effects using pure CSS, inspired by [this codrops article](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/08/08/circle-hover-effects-with-css-transitions/), powered by Sass.
This is a stripped down version with only one effect and with all the excess clutter stripped away

See the original repository here: https://github.com/gudh/ihover

## Why?

This is just a fork I am using as a submodule in another project where I didn't need the full iHover functionality
